    <p>
        The CryptoKeywords application runs on the Ethereum network and utilises smart contracts with individual ERC721 
        tokens (with each being known as a “Smart Contract”) to allow users to buy and own unique, one-of-a-kind keyword 
        Smart Contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
        Throughout these Terms of Service, the Smart Contracts and the Site hosting the service will be known as the 
        “Service”.
        </p>
        <p>
        By choosing to use the Service, users can purchase and own keyword Smart Contracts. CryptoKeywords 
        is making the Service available to you. Prior to using the Service, you must agree to these Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <p>
        Read the following Terms of Service carefully and thoroughly prior to using the Service, purchasing Smart 
        Contracts, or using the Site. Unless we have a separate, written agreement with you that differs from the below 
        Terms of Service, the following Terms of Service absolutely and unequivocally govern your use of the Site, 
        purchase of Smart Contracts, and ownership of Smart Contracts. We will only allow you to use this Site, own 
        Smart Contracts, and/or purchase Smart Contracts if you accept all of these Terms of Service.

        <h4>
        1. We do not accept deposits.
        </h4>
        <p>
        CryptoKeywords.com is a UI interface which allows you to interact directly with a blockchain smart contract on 
        the Ethereum network using the “Metamask” browser extension. The website and its creators do not except or hold 
        any payments from players. Any ether transfers done over the website’s are transferred directly to blockchain 
        contract address. Any Ether or fiat currency deposited into your Metamask extension is fully owned and controlled 
        by the player. The service does not have access to the funds deposited in your Metamask browser extension. 
        Transfers of Ether, are passed directly from your Metamask account to a smart contract on the Ethereum network. 
        Since the service does not except your deposits and does not have any control over it, the service and it's 
        creators are not liable for any damages or lost of funds.
        </p>
        <h4>
        2. Use responsibly. This is not an investment vehicle.
        </h4>
        <p>
        This service allows you to buy and collect digital assets. There is no guarantee that other players or anyone 
        else will buy these assets from you. While some players speculate about their ability to resell their digital 
        assets for a higher value in the future, there is no guarantee that another person will decide to buy your 
        digital asset. If you you choose to transfer ETH in exchange for the ERC721 referred to in the service as “smart 
        contract”, you must accept and understand the risk of potentially not being able to sell your “smart contract” 
        in the future. The service is designed for collectors who choose to pay for the ownership of a digital product 
        referred to as a “smart contracts”. If you choose to speculate over the future value and liquidity of your asset, 
        you must do so at your own risk and not hold the creators of the service or the smart contract liable for any 
        loss or damages. Use responsibly and do not spend more than you feel the digital asset is worth.
        </p>
        <h4>
        3. Smart Contracts
        </h4>
        <p>
        We have used the keywords to create unique, one-of-a-kind “Smart Contracts” which are represented by ERC721 
        tokens on the Ethereum BlockChain. These “Smart Contracts” are not endorsed or supported by any person or entity 
        associated with the keyword. New keyword Smart Contracts will be released as we deem fit. Each keyword Smart 
        Contract may be purchased by you utilising ether. You may purchase any keyword Smart Contract you choose, and 
        any other party may purchase a keyword Smart Contract that you currently own if the other party is willing to 
        pay a higher sum. The price of the tokens are hard coded into the smart contract itself and can not be changed 
        by anyone, including the services creators. You may not stop another party from purchasing a keyword Smart 
        Contract that you currently own, and no other third party may stop you from purchasing a keyword Smart Contract 
        that you wish to own. Whichever party is willing to pay the cost of the keyword Smart Contract may own said 
        Smart Contract after he or she completes the transaction.
        </p>
        <h4>
        4. The Service
        </h4>
        <p>
        This Service requires that you utilise a Google Chrome or Firefox web browser that currently has a MetaMask 
        browser extension installed. MetaMask is an electronic wallet created by a third party that allows you to 
        purchase, store, and engage in transactions using Ethereum cryptocurrency. You may not use any other electronic 
        wallet on the Service other than MetaMask; however, you can use other electronic wallets and third-party 
        applications to transfer funds to your MetaMask wallet in order to make purchases and receive payment on the 
        Service. If you do not log on to the Service with the correct browser (either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox) 
        and/or if the browser does not have the MetaMask extension installed, you will be recognised by the Service, 
        but you will not be able to interact with the Service in any way. Any and all transactions that take place in 
        the Service occur via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that by using the Service, your Ethereum public 
        address will be made visible to other users of the Service as well as third parties each and every time you engage 
        in a transaction on the Service. We do not own and we do not control any of the following third-party products 
        used for the function of this Service: MetaMask, Coinbase, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or the Ethereum 
        network. We do not own and we do not control any other third-party site, product or service that you may choose 
        to access, visit, or use for the purpose of interacting with or using the Service. We will not be held liable, 
        and are not liable, for the acts or omissions by any such third party, nor are we liable, or will we be held 
        liable, for any damage that you may suffer as a result of interacting with or using any of the mentioned or 
        unmentioned third parties. You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you create an 
        account to utilise the Service. You are solely responsible for the safety and security of your MetaMask wallet 
        and/or any other electronic wallet you utilise to interact with the Service. You are solely responsible for the 
        safety and security of your account with us. If you become aware of security breach in regards to your password 
        or your account, you agree to notify us immediately upon discovery at Admin@CryptoKeywords.com.
        </p>
        <h4>
        5. Fees and Payments
        </h4>
        <p>
        If you choose to purchase any keyword Smart Contract” on the Service, any and all transactions will be conducted 
        through the Ethereum network utilising a MetaMask electronic wallet directly to a Smart Contract on the blockchain, 
        which is not controlled by the service creators. We will not have any insight into or control over these payments 
        or transactions, nor will we be able to reverse any transaction that occurs. Because of this, we will have no 
        liability to you or any other third party for any claims or damages that may occur due to any transaction that 
        takes place on the Service and/or in regards to any of the keyword Smart Contracts that we have created. The 
        Ethereum network requires that you pay a transaction fee, commonly known as “Gas”, for every transaction that 
        occurs on the Ethereum network. Gas is intended to fund the hardware and software that runs the Ethereum network, 
        as well as to prevent misuse and spam. If you choose to interact with the Service via our Site or without using 
        the Service or our Site as a portal, you will still need to pay fee for any and every transaction you make on the 
        Ethereum network. The smart contract keeps a 1-5% commission fee on every transaction conducted through it, in 
        addition to the Gas charged by the Ethereum network. The creators of this website and service do not have access 
        or control over these fees, as it is handled directly on the distributed blockchain network. WE DO NOT ACCEPT 
        PAYMENTS DIRECTLY ON OUR WEBSITE.

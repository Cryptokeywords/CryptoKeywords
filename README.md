[CryptoKeywords](https://cryptokeywords.com) is the decentralized keywords registry on the Ethereum blockchain.

At the heart of every search engine is an index of keywords and links. CryptoKeywords is the pioneering service that is building this index all on the blockchain. It aims to build this index independent of any off-chain technologies, such as search engine spiders or algorithmic ranking. Instead, CryptoKeywords will leverage the blockchain on what it does best: transactions.

The index will be populated and grown through exclusive ownership of its entries. Currently, the creation of new entries is controlled by CryptoKeywords. In its pilot version, entries will all be about cryptocurrencies.

The mechanism of owning keywords is gamified, and borrows the same mechanics as collectible trading games on Ethereum. Just like these collectible token games, every asset in CryptoKeywords is an ERC721 token. Similar pricing mechanics have been put in place to make collecting these keyword tokens engaging and fun. Soon, these keyword tokens can be traded on exchanges that support this standard.

The vision is to establish a thriving ecosystem of keyword ownership, trading, and usage.
